# Summary #

The boilerpipe library provides algorithms to detect and remove the surplus "clutter" (boilerplate, templates) around the main textual content of a web page.

The library already provides specific strategies for common tasks (for example: news article extraction) and may also be easily extended for individual problem settings.

Extracting content is very fast (milliseconds), just needs the input document (no global or site-level information required) and is usually quite accurate.

Boilerpipe is a Java library written by Christian Kohlsch端tter. It is released under the Apache License 2.0.

The algorithms used by the library are based on (and extending) some concepts of the paper "[Boilerplate Detection using Shallow Text Features](http://www.l3s.de/~kohlschuetter/boilerplate/)" by Christian Kohlsch端tter et al., presented at WSDM 2010 -- The Third ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining New York City, NY USA.
